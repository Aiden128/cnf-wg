# CNF Conformance Definition Proposal (CCDP)
A  CNF Conformance Definition Proposal (CCDP) is a way to propose, communicate and coordinate on new requirement definitions for the CNF Conformance program. You can read the full details of the project in [CCDP-1](0001-cnf-conformance-definition-proposal-process.md)

This process is still in a alpha state and feedback is welcome.

## Quick start for the CCDP process

Socialize an idea with the CNF WG. You can send your idea to the mailing list, or add it to the agenda for one of the upcoming meetings. Make sure that others think the work is worth taking up and will help review the CCDP and any code changes required.

Follow the process outlined in the [CCDP template](NNNN-ccdp-template.md)
