# Cloud Native Network Function Working Group (CNF-WG)


The Cloud Native Network Function WG (CNF WG) operates under the aegis of CNCF. The focus of the CNF WG is to define the process around evaluating the cloud nativeness of networking applications, aka CNFs. We collaborate with the [CNF Conformance test suite project](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-conformance/blob/master/README-testsuite.md) who work on the mechanics of the conformance tests.

The goal for the group is to create a software conformance program that any network application implementation can use to determine how well it follows cloud native principles and best practices.

The [CNF WG Charter](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-wg/blob/master/charter.md) futher outlines the scope of our group activities as well as intended deliverables.

The CNF Conformance program will evaluate cloud nativeness based on the set of best practices which the CNF WG has chosen. These best practices are chosen following the [CNF Conformance Definition Proposal](ccdps). Anyone in the CNF WG is welcome to participate in the process from creation to selection of proposals.
